This report outlines the outcomes of a project where I employed my proficiency in NoSQL database management, particularly with MongoDB and the PyMongo library, along with other leading database management techniques. My role involved leveraging my skills in constructing aggregation pipelines for data extraction, complemented by integrating various data-related competencies acquired from previous coursework, including Pandas, APIs, and Matplotlib.

The project commenced with the importation of a JSON file containing food establishment ratings into a MongoDB database. Utilizing PyMongo, I executed fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, filtered specific data fields, applied comparison operators, and implemented sorting and limiting techniques for document retrieval from MongoDB.

Additionally, the project entailed the use of advanced aggregation techniques within MongoDB. I transformed the MongoDB query results into a Pandas DataFrame, integrated data from an external API into the MongoDB database, and utilized the data to generate graphical representations using Matplotlib.

Outcomes:
The project was successfully concluded using MongoDB and the PyMongo library, fulfilling all set objectives. My analysis of the food establishment ratings data provided valuable insights, aiding a food magazine in strategizing content for future publications.
